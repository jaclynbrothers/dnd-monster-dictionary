## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I focused on creating an applications for players of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition to retrieve a monster's stats.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would include additional monster information, such as description, attacks, and weaknesses. I would also include a link to view different monster images that users could incorporate into their game. Other features, such as interactive hit points to track damage, could also be implemented.

## Lessons Learned

I experimented with the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Monsters RESTful API to retrieve information for users to look up as a monster's stats.
